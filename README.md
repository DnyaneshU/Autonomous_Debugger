# Autonomous_Debugger
A smart Python-based tool that automatically detects, fixes, and tests C code using static analysis (cppcheck), regex-powered auto-corrections, and autogenerated unit tests. It simplifies debugging by identifying bugs, suggesting fixes, and validating changesâ€”all in one automated workflow.
