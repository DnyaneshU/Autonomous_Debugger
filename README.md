# Autonomous_Debugger
A smart Python-based tool that automatically detects, fixes, and tests C code using static analysis (cppcheck), regex-powered auto-corrections, and autogenerated unit tests. It simplifies debugging by identifying bugs, suggesting fixes, and validating changes—all in one automated workflow.

# 🛠️ Autonomous Debugger for C Code

An intelligent command-line tool that performs **static analysis**, **auto-fixing**, and **unit test generation** for C source code. Built to help developers debug and improve C programs faster with AI-assisted suggestions and automation.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Static Analysis** using `Cppcheck`
- 🛠️ **Auto-Fix Suggestions** for common coding issues
- ✅ **Unit Test Generation** for core functions
- ⚠️ **Error Reporting** with compilation results
- 📄 **Auto-saves Fixed Code** to `fixes/sample_fixed.c`
- 🧪 **Test Execution** and Pass/Fail status

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The tool takes your C source file (`sample.c`) and runs `cppcheck` to detect:
   - Syntax issues
   - Style problems
   - Unused functions
   - Missing headers

2. Based on known patterns, it suggests or applies basic fixes.

3. It auto-generates a test file (`test_sample.c`) that contains unit tests for each detected function.

4. It compiles the test and shows if the fixed code passes or fails unit testing.
